/**
 * Advisor适配器。判断此接口的是不是能支持对应的Advice。五种通知类型，只有三种通知类型适配器
 *
 * Interface allowing extension to the Spring AOP framework to allow
 * handling of new Advisors and Advice types.
 *
 * <p>Implementing objects can create AOP Alliance Interceptors from
 * custom advice types, enabling these advice types to be used
 * in the Spring AOP framework, which uses interception under the covers.
 *
 * <p>There is no need for most Spring users to implement this interface;
 * do so only if you need to introduce more Advisor or Advice types to Spring.
